# Introduction to Cloud Development Environments

## What are Cloud Development Environments?

Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) are development environments that run in the cloud rather than on a local machine. They provide developers with a consistent, pre-configured environment that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.

Key characteristics of Cloud Development Environments include:

- **Remote Execution**: Code runs on cloud resources, not on your local machine
- **Consistent Configuration**: Every developer gets the same environment setup
- **On-demand Resources**: Scale compute resources based on your needs
- **Accessibility**: Access your development environment from any device with a web browser
- **Isolation**: Each developer gets their own isolated environment

## Benefits of Cloud Development Environments

### 1. Improved Developer Onboarding

New team members can be productive on day one without spending days setting up their local development environment. Simply provision a new cloud environment with all the necessary tools and dependencies pre-installed.

### 2. Consistent Development Experience

Eliminate "works on my machine" problems by ensuring all developers use identical environments. This reduces bugs caused by environment differences and makes collaboration easier.

### 3. Resource Flexibility

Need more CPU, memory, or storage for a specific task? With cloud development environments, you can easily scale up resources when needed and scale down when not in use to optimize costs.

### 4. Enhanced Security

Keep source code and sensitive data in the cloud rather than on potentially vulnerable local machines. Implement centralized security policies and access controls.

### 5. Remote Work Support

Enable developers to work from anywhere with just a laptop and internet connection. All the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, so developers don't need powerful local machines.

### 6. Cost Optimization

Automatically shut down idle environments to save on cloud costs. Pay only for the resources you actually use.

## Introduction to Coder

[Coder](https://coder.com) is an open-source platform that enables organizations to provision and manage cloud development environments. With Coder, you can:

- Define development environments as code using Terraform
- Provision environments on various infrastructure providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes)
- Connect to environments through a secure Wireguard tunnel
- Use your preferred IDE (VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, etc.)
- Automatically shut down idle environments to save costs

In this workshop, we'll be using Coder to create and manage development environments on AWS infrastructure.

## Workshop Environment Architecture

For this workshop, we've deployed Coder on AWS using the following architecture:

![Workshop Architecture](../images/workshop-architecture.png)

- **Amazon EKS**: Hosts the Coder control plane
- **Amazon EC2**: Provides compute resources for development environments
- **Amazon Cognito**: Handles user authentication
- **AWS IAM**: Manages permissions for Coder to provision resources
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Provides secure access to development environments

## Next Steps

Now that you understand what cloud development environments are and how they can benefit your development workflow, let's move on to [Setting Up Your First Development Environment](../02-first-environment/README.md).
